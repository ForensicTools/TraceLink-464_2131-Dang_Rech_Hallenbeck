I. Requirements

Need to have 3.x Python installed to run the script.
Focuses on Mac OS X for use of commands.

II. Running Instruction

Run the program by entering:

python3.3 ./tracelink.py

Into your terminal when the program is located in your CWD.
If it is located elsewhere simply execute the python file with the correct directory.

III. Known Bugs

Must enter full path name e.g. /Users/Marshall/Downloads/

May receive indentation error from Python, to fix (in VIM) run this set command:
	:set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 expandtab
	
In testing, not being a root user limited the mdls command information. 
Being a non-root user, we were unable to retreive certain information that we needed to have.

IV. Updates

Version 1.6: Remove user input when the program is running.
	     Add in help feature to run the program correctly.
	     User can now put relative path.

Version 1.5: Added a nice easy reading format of output.

Version 1.4: Added command for internet history
	     Added check to see if anything was in the specified directory and if not, terminates the program.

Version 1.3: Added MDLS functionality and parsing for website url

Version 1.2: Added option for recursion

Version 1.1: Currently using os.system and subprocess together - need to merge over to pure subprocess
