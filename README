I. Running Instruction

Run the program by entering:

./tracelink.py

into your terminal when the program is located in your CWD.
If it is located elsewhere simply execute the python file with the correct directory.

II. Known Bugs

Must enter full path name e.g. /Users/Marshall/Downloads/

May receive indentation error from Python, to fix (in VIM) run this set command:
	:set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 expandtab

III. Updates

Currently using os.system and subprocess together - need to merge over to pure subprocess


IV. About Us

We are all students majoring in Information Security and Forensics at Rochester 
Institute of Technology. This project was started because of a class called 
Computer System Forensics, where we were tasked to create a forensics tool 
for the community.
