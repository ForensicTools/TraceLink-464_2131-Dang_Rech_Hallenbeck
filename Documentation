Brief Tool Overview

Tracelink will be a tool to identify connections between files and metadata. The idea that we are going for is to be able to track where files are coming from and to see if the user visited these places. This mapping process will allow investigators to connect the dots. We are able to connect these links because of the tool called mdls. What this tool does is that it retrieves metadata information from a certain file. A key aspect of the tool is that it can retrieve where the file was downloaded from. Using this information, we would be able to connect it with a userâ€™s browsing history.

Tracelink will be able to connect these dots, but furthermore it will give mismatches of files. What this means is that it will be able to detect if a file on a system was actually downloaded from a site. If a file is on a system but not found in the history, this could be a problem and a flag that would be good to detect. It also will be able to reveal the opposite of that. The tool will be able to show what sites the user has gone to with no files that have been downloaded. These websites might be flagged as irrelevant because we are looking for connections between the files and the history.
